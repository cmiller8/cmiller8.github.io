A while back we went to a whiskey tasting at <a title="Koval Caraway Liqueur" href="http://www.koval-distillery.com/" target="_blank">Koval Distillery</a> in our neighborhood, and came home with a bottle of their caraway liqueur. &nbsp;I do love a whiskey cocktail and after Swedish Chefing<a href="#one_969" name='one_969_source'><sup>[1]</sup></a> around in the kitchen a little bit, I came up with the following. &nbsp;Serve in a rocks glass over one big-ass cube. (I'm sure there's a name for those big-ass cubes, but I'm not that fancy)

* 2p Bulleit Rye
* 1p Caraway Liqueur
* 1p Grapefruit juice
* Dash of Angostura

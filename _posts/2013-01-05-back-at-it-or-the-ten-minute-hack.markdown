So... the blog has been languishing. &nbsp;I've been meaning to post, really I have, but well, you know. &nbsp;Busy busy. &nbsp;Always too busy. &nbsp;And I have all of these Capital-I-Ideas for huge epic posts about how to make the world a better place and all the crazy stuff I'm planning to make/build/program, but every time I sit down to try to write one, it's too intimidating. &nbsp;So I'm taking a combined page from my wife--who has recently started blogging just a short paragraph each day in order to blog more frequently--and from David Kadavy (by way of lifehacker.com) and his <a title="The Ten Minute Hack" href="http://lifehacker.com/5889332/the-10+minute-hack" target="_blank">Ten Minute Hack</a>. &nbsp;I love this idea. &nbsp;I have two seemingly incongruous tendencies, which are that I am fairly scattered and have a few too many balls in the air most of the time, but when I really get going on something, I will focus on it for hours at a time, forgetting to eat or drink or look at the clock. (This sometimes results in dropping the aforementioned balls, but that's fodder for another post.) The Hack is a beautiful motivator to get over that hump of inertia and reach the point where you're no longer looking at the clock. &nbsp;And if after ten minutes you're still looking at the clock? &nbsp;Move on and go about your day. &nbsp;Pretty cool, right? &nbsp;And it's working before your very eyes. &nbsp;I've been at this post now for 25 minutes, and only just now looked at the clock.


So, I'll be attempting to Ten-Minute-Hack my way to more prolific blogging in the future. Wish me luck.

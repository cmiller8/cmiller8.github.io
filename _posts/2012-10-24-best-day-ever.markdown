Wow. &nbsp;It's taken me a couple of days to fully process the three days full of love and joy that were our wedding, but now Jen and I want to say a huge <em>THANK YOU</em>&nbsp;to all of the people that came out to California or just sent their well-wishes and made this weekend the happiest, most perfect that we could have possibly imagined.


Getting married is awesome, y'all.


It's been 5 months (to the day) since I last posted to my blog, because that's about when all of the crazy started. &nbsp;We had just kicked the wedding planning from "casual" to "serious" mode when Jen got hired back in Chicago, and we discovered were were going to be moving. Quickly. To make a long story short, within six weeks of Jen getting the job, we had packed up and moved back to Chicago. &nbsp;Six weeks after that, Jen ran the Chicago Marathon, and two weeks later we were back in California getting married. The last four months have been a bit nuts, but this weekend we remembered what it was all for.

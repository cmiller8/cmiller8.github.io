We're currently on the fast train between Munich and Berlin and as I'm watching southern Germany fly by in the morning light, I'm remembering back about four years ago. My open-ended trip across the US took me through morning-sun-drenched fields very similar to these--on a German motorcycle, no less. While I never quite put it into words at the time, I was struck by the thought, however clich&eacute;, that the sun rises on these fields every morning just like it does in Chicago. I was pretty caught up in my own problems in those months and seeking a little perspective, which I think I found over time. This feels like an extension of that moment. A simple reminder that whatever's going on in <em>my</em> world, there are 7 billion other people in <em>our</em> world.

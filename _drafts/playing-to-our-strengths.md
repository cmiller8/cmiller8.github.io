In the picture above, you are witnessing a project's ass being kicked. Hot on the heels of the [closet shelves project][shelves], we are digging in and getting ready to finally install trim and casings around our doors and windows, which we had to pull down in order to re-drywall the house.  The Lovely Wife, a professional project ass-kicker, has created one of the most impressive spreadsheets I've ever seen in order to calculate how many lengths of each different component of the trim we need. (to be fair, I try to avoid spreadsheets in my day-to-day)

Work Ethic

Ability to envision something abstract, then work to make it a reality

Ability to work within constraints

  - budget
  - deadlines

Ability to work outside of a strict framework and think creatively

Only those who are really good at what they do make it, which means that you're constantly working to improve yourself, and good enough is never good enough

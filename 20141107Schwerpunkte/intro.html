The more science becomes divided into specialised disciplines, the more important it becomes to find unifying principles. 

<br><br>What we need to understand is not the behaviour of individual parts but rather their orchestration. Often, our goals must not be to understand what things are made of, but rather how they are compounded and work together in integrated wholes. We can call this system science. (Skyttner 2005)
